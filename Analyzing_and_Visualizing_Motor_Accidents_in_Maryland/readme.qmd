## Introduction

Maryland is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States well-connected by Interstate and State highways. According to the official Maryland government website, [Zero Deaths](https://zerodeathsmd.gov/resources/crashdata/), there were 476 crash reports resulting in a fatal injury of 511 people in the year 2023. The Maryland State government provides a website for the live updates on transportation related news such as traffic incidents, traffic alerts, and weather alerts to keep its citizens safe [Live Updates](https://chart.maryland.gov/Incidents/GetIncidents). Even with such initiatives from the State government, an average of 295 crashes are reported daily in Maryland [MD Accident Statistics](https://ricelawmd.com/maryland-crash-accident-statistics/#:~:text=Accidents%20in%20Maryland%20are%20a,and%20the%20numbers%20are%20astonishing.). The Zero Deaths is an initiative of [the Maryland Highway safety Office](https://zerodeathsmd.gov/highway-safety-office/) which is a division of the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration (MDOT MVA) with a data-driven approach to reach the goal of zero roadway fatalities and serious injuries.

## Objective

This project focuses on analyzing the motor crashes in the state of Maryland in the US. I try to develop a map of the accident prone areas in the state that would be helpful for drivers to be cautious and on further application could be integrated with Open Street Map to highlight dangerous spots on the highway.

The first part of the project is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The analysis has two parts -

1)  *Analysis based on the Crash Fatality*

-   There are three levels of fatality - Property Damage, Injury, and Fatal
-   The project studies the frequency of each crash and a basic count grouped by the county

2)  *Analysis based in the County of Crash*

-   The project focuses on how frequent the crashes are in each county of the State
-   The analysis finds the counties with the maximum and minimum crash reports
-   Moreover, the crashes are further grouped based on the fatalities.

The second part of this project is the visualization of the analysis. Numerous `bar plots` and `scatter plots` are plotted to prove the analysis.

The final part of this project is a mapping of the crash spots on the Maryland map with the highways marked on it. This map intends to be useful as a precautionary guide for drivers in Maryland.

## Tools

-   R programming language in RStudio
-   Quarto Documentation
-   Presentation slides using revealJS
-   GitHub Repository and Git for committing, pulling, and pushing to origin

## Data Sources

I used three data sources for the implementation of this project.

### Maryland Crash Data

- Data Source: [Maryland Crash Data](https://mdsp.maryland.gov/Pages/Dashboards/CrashDataDownload.aspx)

-   The dataset extracted is filtered for crashes in Maryland from 01st January 2023 to 12th December 2023.
-   The dataset consists of the columns - `Reporttype`, `Date`, `CountyofCrash`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` - that are required for the analysis and mapping.
-   The first three are used for the EDA. It gave the understanding of how the crash type (Reporttype) and Counties are related. Also, a brief time analysis over the months were conducted for each county based on the fatality of the crashes.

```         
library(sf)
crash_data <- read.csv("data/CrashMap_REPORT_data.csv", sep = '\t', fileEncoding = "UTF-16LE")
#attributes(crash_data)
crash_sf <- st_as_sf(crash_data, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
```

### US State Polygons

This is the pre-defined data set in the `spData` package which consists of the geometry for the US states. This is used to plot the outline of the state of Maryland.

```         
library(spData)
maryland <- filter(us_states, NAME == "Maryland")
maryland<- st_transform(maryland, crs = 4326)
maryland
```

### Open Street Map

The `osmdata` package is used to extract the data of the highways in Maryland. This can be used to plot the roads on to which the accident prone zones can be marked.

The bounding box function, `bbox()` is applied and the extracted data is stored as an sf object in the variable `maryland_highways`

```         
library(osmdata)
q <- getbb ('Maryland, USA', format_out = 'polygon')
maryland_highways <- opq(bbox = q, timeout = 100) |>
  add_osm_feature(key = 'highway', value = 'motorway') |>
  osmdata_sf()
maryland_highways <- maryland_highways$osm_lines
file_path <- "maryland_highways_data.geojson"
st_write(maryland_highways, file_path, driver = "GeoJSON")
md_highways <- st_read("data/maryland_highways_data.geojson")
```

## Methodology

-   Data Collection and Storage - URLs, spData, osmdata: The method of data collection and data extraction are given in the [Data Section](#data)
-   Data Extraction - read_sf, read.csv()
-   Data Pre-processing - dplyr, base

    - The Pre-processing involved data cleaning by checking for NULL values and consistency of values in the records
    - Further, the data type of the `Date` column was converted to `Date` format which was initially `character` type
    
-   Exploratory Data Analysis - dplyr, sf

    -   A number of analysis was conducted on the data set to derive useful insights
    -   The analysis focused on grouping the data set based on County, Crash severity `(Reporttype)`, and Date
-   Visualization - ggplot2, plotly

    -   All the analysis results were plotted using bar plots and scatter plots for better understanding and pattern recognition
-   Mapping - ggplot2, plotly

    - An interactive map was developed to visualize the crash spots on the higways in the state of Maryland
    - A map with just the Fatal Crash spots was also plotted to get a closer look at those spots.

## Insights from the Analysis

### Prince George's County

Highest Number of -

- Total Crashes (Baltimore County close second)
- Fatal Accidents
- Property Damage Accidents

Higher fatal crashes occur on Sundays and Mondays


### Baltimore City County

Highest Number of Injury Crashes

Higher fatal crashes occur on Sundays and relatively; Lesser on Tuesdays and Thursdays


### General Trend in Crashes

- There is a dip in number of accidents during the Summer and Fall months (from June to Sept) in most counties

#### Exceptions

Queen Anne's, Somerset, and Worcester


### Mapping

-   The map gives the distribution of the accident points in Maryland.

-   The map of fatal accident points give a denser distribution along the marked highways.

### Random Highlights

-   Since, the `Maryland Crash dataset` is dated from 1st January 2023 to 12th December 2023, the number of accidents in December is very less as compared to other months and cannot be used for comparison.

-   We can see that there is a decline in the number of crashes in the Summer and Fall months of the year (from June through September) in most counties except Queen Anne's, Somerset, and Worcester counties.

- Kent County has the least number of overall as well as the least crashes in all accident types

- Less fatal crashes occur on Wednesdays as compared to other days of the week 

-   Also, Garrett county shows the most irregular trend in number of crashes throughout the year.


## Limitations and Future Work

-   The mapping did not turn out to give a useful indicator of accident zones due to the amassing of points.

-   Due to the huge file size of the open street data objects, only one key-value pair for the highway key was used for plotting.

-   The mapping can be limited just to the highways by joining the two data sets based on the geometry column such that the accident points in the highway are only used for mapping.

-   The mapping can be further extended to do more spatial statistics to find accident prone zones that can be used to give precaution signals and notification in driver's device
